        <h1>UI elements - A deep dive in designing buttons</h1>
        <p>
          During my deep dive week, I have been diving into the design of UI
          elements and what makes an UI element good. When I just started this
          project, my mind was focused on design, but I quickly discovered that
          UI elements are much more than just that. The colors we choose, the
          fonts we choose, the shapes and sizes are all design choices that
          should be taken into account, but furthermore, the words that we
          choose have also a great impact on the overall user experience. On
          this page, you will learn all you need to know about button design, as
          well as writing for UX.
