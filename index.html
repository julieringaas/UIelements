        <h1>UI elements - A deep dive in designing buttons</h1>
        <p>
          During my deep dive week, I have been diving into the design of UI
          elements and what makes an UI element good. When I just started this
          project, my mind was focused on design, but I quickly discovered that
          UI elements are much more than just that. The colors we choose, the
          fonts we choose, the shapes and sizes are all design choices that
          should be taken into account, but furthermore, the words that we
          choose have also a great impact on the overall user experience. On
          this page, you will learn all you need to know about button design, as
          well as writing for UX.

        <h2>Design for human</h2>
        <p>
          Firstly, I want to stress what Margaret Gould, the director of product
          design in Facebook, said at a conference in 2014:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          It’s kind of arrogant to think the only reason people exist is to use
          what you built. They actually have lives, like, outside the experience
          they have using your product, and so the first step of designing in a
          human-centered way is to recognize that they’re humans.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          So in our design choices, we should have the human in mind, with all
          the layers, not only a human as a user.

        <h2>Contrast - Make your buttons stand out</h2>
        <p>
          We know that users never read, they just scan the interface to find
          what they want. And in order for us to make the user find what they
          are looking for in a seemingly simple way, we need to design our
          buttons so that they stand out. We can make the button stand out by
          adding contrast, such as giving it a brighter color or by making it
          bigger.
