        <h2>1. Make your buttons stand out
        </h2>
        <p>We know that users never read, they just scan the interface to find what they want. And in order for us to make the user find what they are looking for in a seemingly simple way, we need to design our buttons so that they stand out. We can make the button stand out by giving it a brighter color or by making it bigger. </p>

  <h2>2.Consistency</h2>
  <p>Consistency is key in most design, and buttons is not different. This makes it easier for the user to navigate, and we'll get the sense of that the buttons belong to each other and that they serve a reliable function.</p>

  <h2>3. Make them large enough</h2>
  <p>Tablets and phones are the most common platform where we use buttons. This requires a "new" way of thinking when it comes to buttons. We have to consider the anatomy of the finger, and make the buttons large enough so that people can be able to click on them. Pressing a button should be a simple task, and if it's not, it can lead to frustration. For most platforms, a button should be at least 48 x 48 dp, which equals to a physical size of 9mm. A button should be somewhere inbetween 7-10mm. Source: <a href="https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/how-to-design-button/">Orbit Media</a> </p>

  <h2>4. Design for accessibility</h2>
  <p>Target area, font size, colors and contrast are all component that has an impact on accessibility. We have to consider all our users. Luckily there are a lot of free online tools that we can use in order to measure our accessibility.</p>
