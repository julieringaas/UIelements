        <p>
       Not only is the design of the buttons important, but moreover the microcopy is also crucial, or at least there is a lot of potential there. Buttons need action words, and the action word should describe exactly what’s going to happen when you click on it. For example:
      <ul>
          <li>Learn more</li>
          <li>Sign up</li>
          <li>View my account</li>
      </ul>
        </p>
        <p>A rule of thumb when writing the microcopy for our buttons is passing the WHYLTIWLT test, which means: would you like to/I would like to. “Would you like to learn more?”. </p>

        <h2>Use the potential</h2>
        <p>The microcopy in our UI is extremely important and there is a lot of potential lying in our choice of words, and we should take advantage of it. Every button, tips, form, 404 pages should have a text. This can make the website more personal and genuine and make it more fun to navigate. This can also create loyalty, conversion and satisfaction. The source used for the content of this website is <a href="https://www.synapsestudios.com/learn/writing-for-ux"> Synapses Studios</a></p>
