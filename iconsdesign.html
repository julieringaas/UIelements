        <h1>Icons</h1>
        <p>
          When designing icon sets for your website or your brand, I’ve
          discovered some fundamental rules in order to design them. On this
          page I will guide you through them.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Consistent weight</h2>
        <p>
          Consistency is nothing new within design. When making icons for a
          brand the logos have to look similar, and in order to do so, the
          weight, width and height has to be the same throughout. If there is
          inconsistency, the brand can lose their professional image.

        <h2>2. Simplicity - Less is more</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to designing icons, minimalism and simplicity is the
          key. When we are designing icons, our focus should be context, and
          communicating the action that the icon represents, with fewer design
          elements. Icons should be reduced to a minimal form, only expressing
          the essential characteristics.

        <h2>3. White space</h2>
        <p>
          White space is important in all design, also when designing icons. The
          use of white space will improve the overall experience. An icon should
          have a balanced white space on both sides. The use of white space also
          supports the previous rules of sticking to simplicity, we don’t want
          too many elements that can result in an untidy and confusing icon.
          Most icons have a small working canvas, and that should be taken into
          consideration when we are designing them. Once we minimize an icon, we
          lose white space, and if we have too many elements, the icon will not
          be as intuitive.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Shapes</h2>
        <p>
          You might have noticed that a lot of icon sets are shaped
          geometrically. And there is a reason for that. When designing icons,
          we should let the freeform spirit go, and stick with geometric shapes.
          The reason is that these are easier for the user to understand, and
          that is our main goal. Use shapes as circles, squares, rectangles etc,
          and center the elements. This will make your icon look more stable and
          reliable, and the user can easily navigate through your content
          without being insecure.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Colors and contrast</h2>
        <p>
          If we’re creating icons for a brand, the color we chose in our icon
          set should be the same as the brand. Avoid using clashing colors and
          consider sticking with one color, or maybe a monochromatic style, to
          maintain the simplicity and minimalistic style. Contrast is also
          something to keep in mind, avoid using too dark or too light colors.
          Too dark colors can make it hard for the user to identify what the
          icon is. Too light color can dilute its appearance, and lose its
          purpose. The source used for this page is
